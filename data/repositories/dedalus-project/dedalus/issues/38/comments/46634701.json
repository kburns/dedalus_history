In Dedalus, the \"resolution\" of the bases corresponds to dealiased modes, and dealiasing is done by padding the modes by 3/2 before transforming, so these Dedalus simulations correspond to a grid size of 768 x 768.  If you're comparing to other codes which start with a 512 x 512 grid and apply a 2/3 truncation to dealias, then the right comparison would be to set the Dedalus basis resolution to 341, and the dealias keyword to 512/341 to end up on a 512 x 512 grid.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Pierre, another big thing to check -- are you trying to compare to other spectral codes using 512 x 512 dealiased modes or a 512 x 512 grid?
