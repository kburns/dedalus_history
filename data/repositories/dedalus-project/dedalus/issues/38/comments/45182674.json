All codes implement a Runge-Kutta 4 scheme and it is often a good and simple choice for real life simulations.\n\nFor the considered case (NS2D, Fourier-Fourier, RK4), Dedalus is indeed quite slow (~ 15 time slower than fluidsim).  Of course I'm going to point out that Dedalus is very versatile and that it has been more optimized for bounded domains with Chebyshev methods.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Keaton,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your nice answer.</p>\n<p>For simplicity and to be fair with all codes, I will simply compare the elapsed time for 10 RK4 time steps.
