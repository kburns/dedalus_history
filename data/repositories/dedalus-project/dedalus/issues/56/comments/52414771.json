The primary disadvantage of outputting NETCDF4 is that it is used primarily by one subset of people who use Dedalus, a subset \\[geosciences\\] that none of the primary developers are experts in. Thus, we focused on creating a file format that works well for the diverse applications we use Dedalus on, maintaining a minimal set of dependencies \\(e.g. not having to have users install a NETCDF library as well as HDF5, which they would still need\\). Given the limited developer time, and the fact that our existing HDF5 standard seems to work \\(perhaps not ideally, as you have found!\\), we have not added NETCDF4.\n\nAs for your second question, no, any algorithm designed to read HDF5 would not also work for NETCDF4. The reason is that NETCDF4 is a subset of HDF5. Dedalus\u2019s output files are a different subset of HDF5, with different conventions and different ways of storing data. \n\nUnfortunately, any data file choice will involve technical friction on someone\u2019s part. Thanks for your comment, we will probably be more likely to add the xarray feature now that we know at least one user would directly benefit from it!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Tomas,</p>\n<p>Thanks for your comment; it\u2019s really helpful to hear from users!
