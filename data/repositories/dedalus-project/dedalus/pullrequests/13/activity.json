{"pagelen": 50, "values": [{"update": {"description": "This pull request includes three distinct changes:\r\n\r\nEigenvalue solver:\r\nThis is WIP. It solved for eigenvalues by making a dense matrix from our problem, under the substitution dt -> -i omega. This should be cleaned up to probably substitute dt -> gamma, and then sort the eigenvalues, as most of the eigenvalues are going to be either nan's or inf's because our M matrix is singular.\r\n\r\nAntidifferentiate methods:\r\nThe inverse of the differentiate method. You can specify a boundary condition: either the function is zero on the left or zero on the right.\r\n\r\nMid-domain BC:\r\nThis is WIP. I tried to set a boundary condition in the middle of the domain. I think this is implemented correctly, but when I tested it, I got non-sense after a single iteration. So more testing is needed on this feature.\r\n\r\nBug fix:\r\nI think I fixed a bug in the boundary value problem evaluation logic. I think the evaluator has changed since BVP was written, so you needed to give a bit more information to the evaluator.", "title": "WIP: Eigenvalue solver; antidifferentiate methods; mid-domain BC", "reviewers": [], "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "464ed09e19a0", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/dedalus-project/dedalus/commit/464ed09e19a0.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/dedalus-project/dedalus/commits/464ed09e19a0"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/dedalus-project/dedalus.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/dedalus-project/dedalus"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{1dc39ab6-2798-450d-af2f-e976f94b5794}ts=2009435"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "dedalus", "full_name": "dedalus-project/dedalus", "uuid": "{1dc39ab6-2798-450d-af2f-e976f94b5794}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "state": "DECLINED", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "b9e8dc996761", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/lecoanet/dedalus2-lecoanet-old/commit/b9e8dc996761"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/lecoanet/dedalus2-lecoanet-old/commits/b9e8dc996761"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/lecoanet/dedalus2-lecoanet-old"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/lecoanet/dedalus2-lecoanet-old"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{97b351f4-3a92-42a4-985a-146e7cfb9d40}ts=python"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "dedalus2-lecoanet-old", "full_name": "lecoanet/dedalus2-lecoanet-old", "uuid": "{97b351f4-3a92-42a4-985a-146e7cfb9d40}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "Too many things in one pull request -- each feature will be implemented (in some form or another) in other pull requests.", "author": {"display_name": "Daniel Lecoanet", "uuid": "{0ff8d177-8703-4f25-93d4-68857e948a31}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B0ff8d177-8703-4f25-93d4-68857e948a31%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B0ff8d177-8703-4f25-93d4-68857e948a31%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/829d5ddfabf278a6c21111d4de2fe031d=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsDL-3.png"}}, "nickname": "lecoanet", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:ba5c14ee-54e1-4d72-aa9e-1e2a4c5ab718"}, "date": "2014-06-06T02:28:22.851783+00:00", "changes": {"status": {"new": "rejected", "old": "open"}}}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 13, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/dedalus-project/dedalus/pullrequests/13.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/dedalus-project/dedalus/pull-requests/13"}}, "title": "WIP: Eigenvalue solver; antidifferentiate methods; mid-domain BC"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/dedalus-project/dedalus/pullrequests/13/comments/2068789.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/dedalus-project/dedalus/pull-requests/13/_/diff#comment-2068789"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 13, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/dedalus-project/dedalus/pullrequests/13.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/dedalus-project/dedalus/pull-requests/13"}}, "title": "WIP: Eigenvalue solver; antidifferentiate methods; mid-domain BC"}, "content": {"raw": "Sounds good.
