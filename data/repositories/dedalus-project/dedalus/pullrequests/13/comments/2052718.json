At this level, the RHS dz cost is within a factor of 2 of the sparse solve. So definitely worth moving dz to implicit side at this point whenever possible. I expect that adding an additional eqn (eg, rho_z -dz(rho) = 0) will cost less in general than doing a RHS dz. I'll test this and get back to everyone.
