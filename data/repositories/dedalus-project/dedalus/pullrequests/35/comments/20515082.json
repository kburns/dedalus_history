I've tested your fix, but I've made one change. Rather than making a list of allowed_dirs and not restarting all others, I've reversed the logic to have an excluded_dirs list. This way, by default it will pick everything up. I think your use case might be the less common one. Regardless, this way, if you do something wrong, the simulation will simply die immediately. With the allowed_dirs method, if you forget to put all the analysis tasks in the allowed_dirs, the simulation will run, but will not continue all those analyses.
