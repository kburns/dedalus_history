The only reason I can come up with having one is if you're worried that the parser isn't working.

As for the MatrixProblem being pedagogically useful...  I think whenever problems popped up with the MatrixProblem, it would take a long time for me to convince myself that I had entered in the correct equations.  Only then would I consider if the equations I had entered in made any sense.  In that sense, I actually think the ParsedProblem is more pedagogically useful, because I have some faith that it's parsing my equations properly.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hey Jeff -- I agree with Keaton that it's not worth having a MatrixProblem.
